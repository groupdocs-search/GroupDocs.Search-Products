    content: |
       The amount of data and information is rapidly increasing with every passing day.  Therefore, it is very important to retrieve the correct information in a timely manner with minimum cost and effort. This webpage is going to provide information about how users can develop and add efficient documents searching capabilities to their business applications. . The aim is to quickly and accurately find and display information related to userâ€™s queries.  GroupDocs.Search for Java is very efficient and simple to use Java API that helps software developers to operate basic to advanced level text search operations inside their own apps without installing any third party software.  The Java API has provided several useful features related to searching such as merge multiple indexes into a common index, search queries recognition of different keyboard layout, morphological Word Form support and so on.  It supports simple, Boolean, regular expression (Regex), fuzzy, case sensitive search, synonym, homophone, wildcard, object type search, setting data range and other types of queries to quickly and elegantly search out information..
